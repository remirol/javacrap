Running

Your program is supposed to handle runners that has run a race. The Race was open for both elite runners and excercise runners.

Each eliter runner had in this system a start number, name, time, club-beloning and licens-number.

Each excercise runner had a startnumber, name, time and registration wheater they have ordered a T-shirt or not.


Implement a inheritance hierarcy for the runners. The base class, which is supposed to be abstract, will contain at least one abstract method that is related to when a runner object is being presented on screen.
The baseclass is supposed containe as much as possible so the sub-classes only contain what is specific for them.
Only private instance variables.

After that make a class containing the main(..)-method, wich handles runners. That class will use one (1!) ArrayList as a "container" for the runners.
There should be a meny that offers the following functionality:
- add excercise runner
- add elite runner
- Show all excersice runner
- show all elite  runners
- show all runners

All these alternatives should result in calls of suitable methods.
