Phone book

You will create a program that works like a simple phonebook. For every person name and phone number is going to get stored. It should be possible by a menu to:

1. Add people
2. Search for people with a given name
3. Search for a person with a given number.
4. Sort people in alphabetical order
5. Show all people
6. End

Your solution shall contain two paralell vectors(fields/arrays); one for phone numbers and one for names. When the program starts the user should tell how many people that 
the phone book at maximum should be able to handle. After that the vectors is adapted to that.

The program should also contain following:
1. A method that presents the menu and the user choices, which are returned.
2. A method that handles the in-data of name, phone numbers and they should be placed in the vectors.
3. A method that handles search for name. The method shall return the position in the vecctor that the name is placed at. If theree is no person with the given name
the vector, it should return -1. No indata in this method.
4. A method that handles the search for numbers. The method, as the previous should return the position of where the phone number is in the vector. And return -1 if 
there is no person with the number. No indata in this method either.
5. A method that sorts by name. Observe that if the names is moved in the name vector, the same movement must take place in the number vector. Tip: Use CompareTo-mehtod
in comparision of strings.
6. A method that shows all people in the phone book, all names with belonging numbers should show.
